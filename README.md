# CloudCast: Real-Time Weather Forecast iOS App

Welcome to CloudCast - an interactive iOS weather forecasting application. This app dives deep into fetching and displaying real data from the internet using Swift and Xcode.

## Overview
CloudCast is more than just a weather app; it's an exploration into how mobile applications can utilize live data to enhance user experience. In this project, I focused on the following key learning areas:

* Using Postman for API Interaction: Learned how to create web requests and inspect network responses using Postman, a powerful tool for API development.
* Networking with URLSession: Implemented URLSession library in iOS to fetch weather data from remote servers.
* Data Parsing with Decodable: Utilized Swift's Decodable protocol to transform serialized data into usable data models, enabling the app to display real-time weather data efficiently.

##Features
* Multiple Locations: Users can switch between different locations to view the current weather conditions.
* Real-Time Data: Fetches and displays real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API for the selected location.
* Weather Details: Provides detailed information about the current weather, including temperature, wind speed, and direction.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Xcode installed on your macOS system. Follow these steps:

* Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/CloudCastPt2.git
* Open CloudCast.xcodeproj in Xcode.
* Build and run the project on your preferred iOS simulator or physical device.

## Usage
Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted with the current weather conditions for the default location. You can navigate through different predefined locations using the arrow buttons on the screen to view their weather conditions.
